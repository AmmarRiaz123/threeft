Your project is in working order.

- Flask backend is modular, uses blueprints, and CORS is enabled.
- PostgreSQL table schema is provided.
- All API endpoints are implemented and tested with pytest.
- requirements.txt lists all dependencies and test command.
- React frontend is set up in voter-frontend, with redundant files removed.
- VoterApp.js is correctly implemented and connects to the backend.
- README_react.txt explains how to set up and run the React app.

**Checklist:**
- Start Flask backend: `python app.py`
- Start React frontend: `npm start` in voter-frontend
- Run backend tests: `pytest -v`
- Confirm both apps run and communicate at http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:5000

**Troubleshooting:**
- If React cannot connect to Flask, check CORS and that both servers are running.
- If database errors occur, verify PostgreSQL connection and table schema.
- If QR scan fails, ensure pyzbar and pillow are installed and image is clear.
- For test failures, check environment variables and DB test data.

If you follow these steps, everything should work as expected.

Yes, the frontend (VoterApp.js) correctly uses all APIs:

- POST /scan-qr: Uploads a QR image, receives qr_id, and displays it.
- GET /voter/<qr_id>: Fetches voter info by qr_id and displays details.
- POST /voter/<qr_id>/vote: Marks voter as voted and shows confirmation or "already voted" message.

All API calls are handled with proper error messages and UI updates.
You can interact with all backend endpoints from the React UI.

All APIs read and write to the database as per their function:

- scan_qr_api.py: Does NOT read/write to the DB (only scans QR from image and returns qr_id).
- voter_info_api.py: READS from the DB (fetches voter info by qr_id from registered_voters table).
- voter_vote_api.py: READS and WRITES to the DB (checks has_voted, updates has_voted and voted_at for the voter).

All database connections use the connection string from config.ini.
The table schema in DBSQL matches the fields used in the APIs.

Your backend is correctly integrated for all database operations.

Pre-test Integration Checklist:

1. **Backend (Flask)**
   - app.py imports and registers all blueprints: scan_qr_api, voter_info_api, voter_vote_api.
   - CORS is enabled in app.py for frontend communication.
   - Environment variables for DB connection are set (or config.ini is used for other modules).
   - PostgreSQL table registered_voters exists and matches DBSQL schema.
   - All API endpoints are implemented:
     - POST /scan-qr (scan_qr_api.py)
     - GET /voter/<qr_id> (voter_info_api.py)
     - POST /voter/<qr_id>/vote (voter_vote_api.py)
   - requirements.txt includes all dependencies for backend and testing.

2. **Frontend (React)**
   - voter-frontend/src/VoterApp.js implements all API calls and UI logic.
   - voter-frontend/src/App.js exports VoterApp.
   - voter-frontend/src/index.js or index.jsx renders VoterApp to #root.
   - Redundant files (App.test.js, setupTests.js, reportWebVitals.js, App.css) are removed.
   - package.json lists react, react-dom, react-scripts, etc.
   - public/index.html contains <div id="root"></div>.
   - README_react.txt explains setup and usage.

3. **Testing**
   - test_api.py covers all endpoints with pytest.
   - requirements.txt includes pytest and qrcode for tests.
   - Run tests with: pytest -v

4. **Database**
   - config.ini or environment variables provide correct DB credentials.
   - PostgreSQL server is running and accessible.

5. **General**
   - All code files are in their correct locations.
   - No missing imports or circular dependencies.
   - All endpoints return expected JSON responses and error handling is present.

**If all above are confirmed, you are ready to start testing.**
